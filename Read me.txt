2. . . . Blog page:

- Editor's pick to be updated dynamically from a list of featured articles.
- The blog area will be populated with current/latest posts. The max number of posts per
  page to be 9.
- The load more button is to reveal more posts on the same page on click



3. . . . Single post page

- The image on the hero is the featured image of the post
- The heading and the date is basically the post meta
- On the left, I would like a counter function for when anyone hits the thumbs-up icon.
  the counter should count up
- The share button is to provide a sharable link for distribution
- The post body is basically everything I will be doing in the editor
- Related posts are all the posts that are in the same category
- The more articles button should link back to the main blog page



4. . . . . Login page
- For this page, I would like a custom login link other than wp-admin. I would like it to be something like smart-code.dev/sammyboy. something unpredictable.



5. . . . . Note that the contact page has a different header and footer design. the let's talk button is hidden in the header and the subscription form is not there in the footer.




6. For the emailing feature, I would like to have this later but for now we can start with having the emails go directly to my email or we can tweak jackie's but I don't the other pages for unsubscription and all... Let me know what you think about this. 


7. . . . . I have commented the main.js file on what you need to change 






###################################### 


I would like your input as well on the best ways to go 
with this site. I would like to add more functionality 
later as we progress. Things like ecommerce when I open a
print on demand merchendize thingy...

Let me know if you also need the dark mode sorted. I am 
writing my css in sass then let the editor generate the css 
for me. Let me know if you need the dark mode before you start
so that I can see if I am going to work on the color change 
today. 

I am working on the cash. I will let you know the minute I get 
it in my hands.
